I contributed across all layers of the stack, delivering and maintaining multiple production systems built with React, Node/Express REST APIs, and MySQL. Over my time at Zebra, I helped develop more than five full-stack applications supporting both customer-facing and internal operations. I worked closely with teams across the organization—including administrative staff, marketing, and curriculum developers—to ensure the software aligned with real business workflows and enabled the company’s growth across North America. My work helped transform Zebra Robotics from a single-location business with static infrastructure into a scalable, franchise-ready organization powered by modern full-stack systems.",

Even early in my role, I contributed to the company’s transition toward a modern React-based platform, helping design and implement the first versions of the new system within a small team of three developers. I gained strong hands-on experience building full-stack features, resolving production issues, and collaborating closely with senior engineers and stakeholders. This role laid the foundation for my growth into larger technical ownership and leadership responsibilities in later positions.",
